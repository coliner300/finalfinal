Description: 
My game is a single player choose your own adventure with a preset story line based off of what the user selects through the adventure. The objective of the game is to get to the final outpost where all of the survivors are located. The game ends when you either die from making a bad decision, or when you get to the survivor outpost. The game starts off with the options, main problem of the story, and the first question to get you started. 

How to play:
You will enter 1, 2, yes, or no based on the question that was asked and this will lead to a similar question with different outcomes.

Interesting Features:
Not only do you have to just get to the survivor outpost, but you have to keep an eye on the food left, which if it gets to zero, then you will die of hunger.
